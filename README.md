#crop yields prediction using machine learning:

##the problem:
Agricultural productivity is critical to ensuring food security, economic stability, and sustainable resource use, particularly in regions heavily dependent on farming. However, crop yields are influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including weather conditions, soil quality, crop management practices, and climate variability. Traditional methods of yield estimation are often reactive, labor-intensive, and unable to effectively capture nonlinear relationships within agricultural data.

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system that can accurately predict crop yields based on historical data such as weather patterns, soil properties, and farming practices. The objective is to enable proactive decision-making for farmers, policymakers, and agribusinesses, allowing them to optimize resource allocation, anticipate food production levels, and mitigate the risks associated with climate change and unpredictable environmental conditions.

By leveraging supervised learning algorithms and real-world datasets, the system will model the relationships between key agricultural inputs and yield outcomes, offering interpretable and actionable insights that support precision agriculture and sustainable farming.

##the objectives:
1. to preprocess the data to make it ready for mcahine learning model
2. to train the model on the existing data
3. to test the model onnew unseen data
